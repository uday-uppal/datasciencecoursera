We are currently in the midst of a technological and computing revolution that will drastically change our
lives and potentially redefine what it means to be human. I am very excited at the prospect of devoting my
long-term career to such a dynamic, fast advancing field. Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed dabbling
with computers and experimenting with different applications. Because my own lifetime has essentially
coincided with the rise of the modern computing industry, I can sense that there are still tremendous
developments to come in this field.
Academic background
Since my early childhood, I have been a coder and generally took part in programming as well. I
have always been fascinated by how these web-applications and animations work. The
fundamentals and the programming languages involved have always intrigued me. My interest in
CS started to develop gradually from here. I always loved cars and when I learned how CS
integrated with AI was being used in cars, my interest in it elevated. In grade XI, I chose
Informatics Practices as my subject wherein I discovered a whole new world of Data Science with
Python, and its popular libraries like Pandas and Numpy. To enhance my skills, I complemented
my learning with courses on my Coursera,, Stanford Online and Udemy. One the most rigorous,as
well as intellectually satisfying courses that I took was the Stanford CS229 Machine Learning
course by Andrew Ng where he covered Machine Learning algorithms with mathematical detail,
something that I did not find in most of the other courses.
Exploring the fields like Mathematics, and Computer Science, outside my curriculum helped me a head
start in my regular academics. It helped build solid understanding of fundamentals and gave me an
exposure to apply the theory to real life problems. All this made me realize my passion and desire to
pursue a career in the field of Computer Science.
I completed my class X in 2020 with 87.4%. from Indraprastha International School, Delhi
affiliated with CBSE and my Class XII in August, 2022 with 97.4%. In my 12 th Grade, my
Subjects are Physics, Chemistry, Maths, English and Informatics Practices.
Apart from my studies, I took part in various other extracurricular activities. I was an active
participant of Swachh Vidyalaya Mission in order to maintain my school clean and even was an
active member in leading the Fit India Plugging run representing my High School. I took part in
many competitions which were held by CBSE and developed many useful apps like during
COVID 19 I developed an App for helping customers to book appointments beforehand
that will avoid crowding at the shops. It tells the customer at what time they should reach
to have the most optimal experience, by taking into account all the bookings made for a
shop. I also interned at Canny Alley Tech Pvt Ltd wherein I learned about data mining and
analytics and gained understanding about how Machine learning models are deployed in
industry. I worked on R, Python, and Microsoft Azure for deploying ML models. These
extracurricular activities were very enjoyable. I got to know about people like Mr. Geoffrey
Hintonwho is known as the “Godfather of AI”. These people inspired me and my passion for AI
got overwhelmingly strong. As my interest and passion for Artificial Intelligence started
developing,I began searching for a degree program in computer Science keeping Artificial
Intelligence as a specialization.
Program Inclination: - Computer Science at University of Toronto
After thorough research I came across the University of Toronto, which is known for its degree in
CS and world renowned education. After completion of my degree, UToronto will also allow me to
specialize in any technological field. This program will help me to seek the opportunity to customize
my degree as per my interests and to work with faculty who are involved in the latest research work . This
course will help me to create software as well as develop effective ways to solve computing
problems, like storing information in databases, sending data over networks, and providing new
solutions to unsolved problems of Artificial Intelligence. This course will help me acquire the

expertise needed to devise new and better ways to address challenges in big data, game
development, medical imaging, social and mobile computing, and bioinformatics. This will help
me to develop my skills in programming languages and data analysis. This program provides a
working knowledge of the foundations of computer science: modern computer software and hardware,
theoretical aspects of computer science, and relevant areas of mathematics and statistics. It also imparts
an appreciation of the discipline&#39;s transformative impact on science and society. The program prepares
students for further study and for careers in the computing industry. The university will help me learn
from one of the best faculties in the field of CS with decades of experience in their respective
fields. The program will help me to develop skills in Applied Mathematics to solve computing
problems. It will help me to critically analyze a problem and to design, implement, and evaluate a
computing solution that meets requirements. I will be able to work effectively on great computing projects.
I plan to pursue ASIP Internship opportunity at University of Toronto, which will enable me to
engage in industry work experience and gain practical experience in the real-world environment.
Canada As My Study Destination
Canada is my prime choice for my higher academic studies for various reasons, first and foremost being
that the education system of Canada is brilliant and is ranked amongst the best. In addition to that,
Canada is a safe and one of the most welcoming nations of the world with superb health care facilities
that will help me nurture my potential and growth. Studying with prestigious students who come from all
over the world will further help me expand my knowledge horizon and develop my overall communication
skills. Hence, I strongly believe that the completion of my studies in Canada will surely enable me to
excel in the field of Computer Science, and Machine Learning.
Future Goals
Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently in the early stages of adoption in India, but its use is
already widespread across various industries. Major sectors like agriculture, education,
healthcare, infrastructure, transport, banking, cybersecurity, manufacturing, entertainment use
AI &amp; ML for research work One of the most significant advantages of AI is the various
technologies it encompasses, such as machine learning, self-improving algorithms, pattern
recognition and more.
India has significant potential for growth in terms of technological infrastructure and digital
adoption and upon completing my degree, I intend to return to my country to pursue a career as
a computer scientist. My goal is to work for leading companies such as Google, IBM, OpenAI,
Microsoft etc. to further improve India&#39;s technological infrastructure and invent new
technologies. The knowledge and experience I will gain during my studies in Canada will surely
help me serve my country in a much better way.
As we look ahead in the future, an increased rate of technological innovation will shape almost
every aspect of our lives in the 21st century. The use of Artificial Intelligence, like any other
technology would have its share of opportunities, and concerns. Hence, I plan to utilize my
knowledge to have a positive impact on society, and make India, and the World a better place to
live.
With all submission, I lay down my interest to study at the University of Toronto. I will be happy
to provide any further information and documents if required. I would be highly grateful if I am
accorded this opportunity to pursue my higher studies in Canada.
Thanks, and Regards
Shyam Uppal
